                In this tutorial, we will explore how to consume web services through Node.js. This guide is divided into three comprehensive parts, alongside a practical example that integrates all the concepts discussed. The structure of each of the parts
                consists in a concise and brief explanation, followed by an example with our node js application in which we are using 3 apis: OpenAi, Spotify and a news api.

        <div class="section card-panel light-green lighten-2">
            <h3>Part 1: Introduction to Web Services and Node.js</h3>
            <p>This section will introduce web services and their importance in modern web development. We'll also dive into Node.js fundamentals, including its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O features.</p>
            <h5>What is Node.js?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Node.js is a server environment</li>
                  <li>Node.js uses JavaScript outside the browser, in other words it uses JavaScript in the server side</li>
                  <li>Node.js enables us to use JavaScript in both client side and server side</li>
                </ul>
            <h5>What is an API?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>API stands for Application Programming Interface.</li>
                <li>It is a set of rules that allows programs to communicate with each other.</li>
                <li>APIs define methods of requesting services from an application or software component.</li>
                <li>They enable integration between different software systems, often over a network.</li>
                <li>APIs can be used to access web-based services, databases, or other resources.</li>
                <li>They provide a layer of security, hiding the details of database or service internals.</li>
                <li>Commonly used in building RESTful web services and applications.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We can imagine a waiter an api whom manages the requests that we (clients) make and make a request on the chef (server)
                finally the waiter delivers our food, we can eat like animals and we dont really know how tjis food was made. 
            </p>

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h5>Part 2: Consuming Web Services Using Node.js</h5>
            <p>In the second part, we'll cover how to use Node.js to make requests to web services. We'll focus on using npm packages like axios or node-fetch to interact with APIs, handle responses, and process JSON data.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h5>Part 3: Advanced Integration and Real-world Application</h5>
            <p>The final part will walk through a practical example that demonstrates how to integrate multiple web services to build a cohesive application. This section aims to solidify your understanding by applying the concepts in a real-world scenario.</p>
