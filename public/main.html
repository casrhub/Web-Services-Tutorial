                In this tutorial, we will explore how to consume web services through Node.js. This guide is divided into three comprehensive parts, alongside a practical example that integrates all the concepts discussed. The structure of each of the parts
                consists in a concise and brief explanation, followed by an example with our node js application in which we are using 3 apis: OpenAi, Spotify and a news api.

            <h3>Part 1: Introduction to Web Services and Node.js</h3>
            <p>This section will introduce web services and their importance in modern web development. We'll also dive into Node.js fundamentals, including its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O features.</p>
            <h5>What is Node.js?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Node.js is a server environment</li>
                  <li>Node.js uses JavaScript outside the browser, in other words it uses JavaScript in the server side</li>
                  <li>Node.js enables us to use JavaScript in both client side and server side</li>
                </ul>
            <h5>What is an API?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>API stands for Application Programming Interface.</li>
                <li>It is a set of rules that allows programs to communicate with each other.</li>
                <li>APIs define methods of requesting services from an application or software component.</li>
                <li>They enable integration between different software systems, often over a network.</li>
                <li>APIs can be used to access web-based services, databases, or other resources.</li>
                <li>They provide a layer of security, hiding the details of database or service internals.</li>
                <li>Commonly used in building RESTful web services and applications.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Consider an API as a waiter who manages the orders we (the clients) place, and relays those requests to the chef (the server). Once the chef prepares our meal, the waiter delivers it to us. This allows us to enjoy our meal without needing to understand the intricacies of how it was prepared.
              </p>
              <h5>HTTP methods</h5>
              
             
            
              
              <p>
                <strong>GET Method:</strong> Imagine you're at a restaurant and you ask the waiter for the menu. The waiter (API) brings the menu to you (the client) from the kitchen (the server). This is like a <code>GET</code> request, where you're requesting to see information. In web terms, it's used to retrieve data from a server at the specified resource. 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>POST Method:</strong> After deciding what you want, you tell the waiter your order. The waiter then conveys your order to the kitchen, where your meal is prepared. This resembles a <code>POST</code> request, where you're sending data (your order) to the server for it to process and store. In web terms, <code>POST</code> is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
              </p>
              <p> We are too lazy to explain the other HTTP methods but our friend Fireship isn't, you will not need other methods for this tutorial
                but its always exciting to learn.

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div class="section card-panel light-green lighten-2" >
            <h5>Part 2: Consuming Web Services Using Node.js</h5>
            <p>In the second part, we'll cover how to use Node.js to make requests to web services. We'll focus on using npm packages like axios or node-fetch to interact with APIs, handle responses, and process JSON data.</p>
            <p>Okay then, by far you should have a notion of what is an api, what is node js and what are http methods, now its time to put this into practice</p>

        <!-- Part 3 -->
        <div class="section">
            <h5>Part 3: Advanced Integration and Real-world Application</h5>
            <p>The final part will walk through a practical example that demonstrates how to integrate multiple web services to build a cohesive application. This section aims to solidify your understanding by applying the concepts in a real-world scenario.</p>
